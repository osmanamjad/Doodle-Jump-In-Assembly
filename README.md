# Doodle-Jump-In-Assembly
Implemented the popular mobile game Doodle Jump using MIPS assembly. You may familiarize yourself with the game here https://poki.com/en/g/doodle-jump?gclid=Cj0KCQjw59n8BRD2ARIsAAmgPmKehON9X3naoC33v2I_QRkieGRNlD_MGVsDSpaHmgLxGr8N57CuKAAaAqFDEALw_wcB. 
Since this is online, I tested my implementation in a simulated environment within MARS, i.e., a simulated bitmap display and a simulated keyboard input.
