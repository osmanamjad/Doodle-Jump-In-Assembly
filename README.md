# Doodle-Jump-In-Assembly
we will implement the popular mobile game Doodle Jump using MIPS assembly. You may familiarize yourself with the game here. Since we don't have access to physical computers with MIPS processors (see MIPS guide here), we will test our implementation in a simulated environment within MARS, i.e., a simulated bitmap display and a simulated keyboard input.
